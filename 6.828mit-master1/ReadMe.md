  The answers for the labs of this course. 

Introduction
---
  MIT 6.828 is a famous course of OS, which is composed of several excellent labs. By completing those labs, we can create a tiny OS called JOS eventually. I think that it is a novel and effictive way to deepen our understanding of mechanism of OS.
